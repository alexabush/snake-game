# Snake Game

### Built with Create-React-App.

## How to Play

## Controls:

Use a,w,s,d; arrow keys; or 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' buttons to control snake (or any combination of these three options!)
**Note** If keys are unresponsive, please click or press the 'Tab' key once to put focus on to the board.

## Bugs/Considerations:

1. Game is only playable when the window size + zoom creates a 7x7 board. I apoligize for the inconveniece. App behavior at other screen sizes is kind of hilarious though.
2. If the controls are unresponsive, please click or press the 'Tab' key once to put focus on to the board. (REPEAT)
3. Snake moves forward one square a second. If you click multiple keys within that second window, the snake will move in the direction of the last key clicked. So if you hit 'left, right, up' in quick succession, the snake will move up and the other keypresses will be ignored.

Eat red squares and prosper!
